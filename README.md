# Patient Readmission Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

## 📌 Overview
This project develops a machine learning model that predicts whether a patient will be readmitted within 30 days of discharge. Using Python's data science ecosystem, the project covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model building, and evaluation.

## 🚀 Project Objectives
- Clean and preprocess patient data  
- Analyse variable distributions and relationships  
- Select the most important predictive features  
- Build machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)  
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC  

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Exploratory data analysis  
- **Scikit-learn** – Model development and evaluation  

## 📊 Key Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   Handling missing values, normalisation, encoding categorical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**  
   Visualisations and insights into patient demographics, admission type, vitals, and readmission trends.

3. **Feature Selection:**  
   Selecting meaningful predictors using correlation analysis and model-based importance.

4. **Model Development:**  
   Training ML algorithms and tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.

5. **Model Evaluation:**  
   Using classification metrics to assess predictive effectiveness and identify overfitting.
